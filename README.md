# Sorting-algorithms

Bubble sort: Uses nested loops to iterate through array, checks if adjacent elements are in order, if not then they are swapped. Continues until array is sorted
Best case time complexity: O(n), when array is already sorted
Worst case time complexity: O(n^2)

Insertion sort: Iterates through array and chooses element as key. Loops through array to place key element in correct position compared to the rest of the array.
Best case: O(n), when array sorted
Worst case: O(n^2)

Selection sort: Chooses first unsorted element as the current minimum. Iterates through array to compare elements with current minimum. If smaller element found, it is swapped with the current min
Best case: O(n^2) sorted array, as it will still loop through the array to find the minimums
Worst case: O(n^2)
